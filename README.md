Working on starting a project to create a Web UI that allows players from around the world to play each other in a way that is platforms agnostic

The idea would be to use a web UI and a sidebar for chat fuctions that deals 7 dominoes to each player visible to only them, allows for logins and password recovery and can be played on Windows, MacOS, Iphone, Android, tablets, whatever

I have seen a number of players on Facebook asking for such an application they can access and use

Also the n42pa.org (National 42 Players Association) has members in Brazil and Germany that are tired of playing AI opponents in existing Android and AppStore 42 apps

Not sure what to use for chat (jabber?) and for the graphics (something like the backend for 42now.com except more focused on real opponents in real time instead of AI players)
